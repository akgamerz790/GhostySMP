# Contributing to GhostySMP ☭

Thank you for Contributing to the GhostySMP Plugin. All contributions serve the State and the collective.

**By following these guidelines, you help keep the project organized, efficient, and revolutionary:**

## 1. How to Contribute

 - Fork the repository and make your changes in a feature branch.

 - Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of your changes.

 - Ensure your code follows GhostySMP coding standards.

 - All contributions must be public and accessible - private forks are forbidden.

## 2. Code Standards

 - Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for variables, PascalCase for classes).

 - Include comments for complex logic.

 - Test your changes thoroughly on a Paper server before submitting.

 ## Variable Naming Rules

 - All variables must be prefixed with _.

 - Variables without the **_** prefix will not be accepted.

 - This ensures consistency, readability, and easy navigation in IDEs.

 - Non-compliant variables will be removed, and the contributor’s code may be rejected.

 ##### - Correct examples:

 ```int _player_count;
 String _player_name;
 boolean _is_enabled;
 ```


 ##### - Incorrect examples:

 ```int playerCount;

 boolean isEnabled;
 ```

 ###### - "If your variable does not start with _, it does not exist."

 - Strict compliance with this rule is mandatory.

## 4. TESTING

 - Test your changes on a Paper server before submitting.

 - Untested code may be rejected without review.

## 5. FINAL AUTHORITY
